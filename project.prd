Wallet Service Assignment
Objectives
We are seeking to create a wallet service that manages users' money. This service will support
operations for depositing, withdrawing, and transferring funds between users.

production environment.

strict deadline.
●
Professionalism: Implement the project with the same care and attention to detail as you
would in a professional setting.
●
Time Tracking: Upon completion, please provide a rough estimate of the time you invested
in the project.
●

Functional Requirements
●
Create Wallet: Allow the creation of wallets for users.
●
Retrieve Balance: Retrieve the current balance of a user's wallet.
●
Retrieve Historical Balance: Retrieve the balance of a user's wallet at a specific
point in the past.
●
Deposit Funds: Enable users to deposit money into their wallets.
●
Withdraw Funds: Enable users to withdraw money from their wallets.

Non-functional requirements
This service is mission-critical. Any downtime would significantly impair the platform's ability to
perform most operations.
Given that the service handles monetary transactions, it is imperative to ensure full traceability of
all operations to facilitate auditing of wallet balances.
Technical Requirements
All technical choices, including the selection of REST/HTTP frameworks or libraries, are at your
discretion.
Deliverables
A GitHub repository containing:
●
The implementation of the microservice.
●
Instructions on how to install, test, and run the service.
●
A written explanation of the design choices, detailing how the implementation meets both
functional and non-functional requirements.
●
A written explanation of any compromises or trade-offs made due to time constraints.
All documentation should be in English.
